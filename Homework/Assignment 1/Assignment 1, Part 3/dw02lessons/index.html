    <h1 >Victoria Hodnett's lowly beet    </h1>
    <p ><img src="images/beets.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt=""/></p>
    <p >Give the beet a break. Beets suffer from an image problem. If there was a food chain in the vegetable world, beets wouldn't rank very high. Of course there is no food chain because vegetables don't eat each other: we're the ones who eat vegetables.</p>
    <p>Now, back to the beet. Why do they get such a bad rap? I think it's because people don't know what to do with them. But let me tell you my favorite way to eat beets. Slather them with olive oil, salt and pepper. Wrap them in tin foil and then stick them in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes or so. When done, let them cool for a bit, now the rough skins will peel right off and you can eat a nice roasted beet. Just don't get the juice on your shirt! It stains something fierce.</p>
    <p>In fact, here's something about beet staining that I bet you didn't know: in the olden days beets were used as fabric dye. Yep, that's right, the red coloring of beets come from a molecule called betanin, which is a natural dye. The really crazy part is that the properties of betanin also produce very small electrical charges, so it's not too far a leap to say that beets will someday provide all of the world's energy. Well maybe not all of it, but a guy can dream can't he?</p>
