<h2>The Science of Sticky</h2>
<p> Spiders crawl up walls. Flies sit on walls.  Geckos climb up walls.  What makes <br>
  these creatures able to scale shear surfaces without falling off?  We've come a long way <br>
  since Velcro.  You'll take an up close look at the hand and feet of these creatures and see <br>
  it's not slime, ooze or goo keeping them from falling off.  It's just plain old hair.  Feel up <br>
  for a bigger challenge?  Put on the Gecko Suit and crawl around on our sixty degree wall. <br>
  See if you can reach the top!  The Fly on the Wall room will have you launching into the <br>
  air on a rope swing trying to stick to the wall on the other side.  Just remember to let go <br>
  of the rope!</p>
<p> But it's not just critters that can stick to things.  Chemical engineering has created <br>
  hundreds of substances that when you apply it between two items, they're never coming <br>
  apart!  You'll take a look at history of bonding agents starting with basic mortar all the <br>
  way through modern complex epoxies. You can even mix up your own batch of <br>
  SuperStick in our virtual chemistry lab.  You'll mix up the glue and then stick a 5 pound, <br>
  50 pound, 200 pound or 1000 pound box to the ceiling.  See who can create strongest <br>
  batch of SuperStick and keep it up there the longest!<br>
