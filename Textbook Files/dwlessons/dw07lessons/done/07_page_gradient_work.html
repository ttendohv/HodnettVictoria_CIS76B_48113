    <h1 >Welcome to organic utopia</h1>
    <p>There's big news at OrganicUtopia this month! We've expanded to include 2 new lines of body and earth-friendly products. We now carry bio-degradeable furniture - imagine a couch you can leave on the street that will slowly decompose back into Mother Earth! We also have added recyclable shopping bags, which eliminate the need for the age-old question &quot;paper or plastic?&quot;. These bags are tough, stylish, and eco-friendly!</p>
    <h1 >What do we do?</h1>
    <p> We've got everything from healthy<a href="#"> lifestyle foods</a> and <a href="#">organic gourmet products</a> to other lifestyle products. We also have a full line of eco-friendly furniture, clothes, candles and home furnishings.</p>
    <h1>One stop shopping</h1>
    <p>You can find it all here, and our online store makes it easy to order! Pick from carefully selected food, lifestyle and home products and add them to your shopping bag, all from the convenience of home. We even offer free shipping on many items, or save you big dollars by shipping items together.</p>
    <h1>Member benefits</h1>
