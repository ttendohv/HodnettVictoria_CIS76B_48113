  <strong>Water is Everywhere</strong></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
        With so much
        of the planet covered in water, we take itÕs presence for granted. It falls
        from the sky as rain, floats down as snow, makes the summers hot and humid,
        and cools us off as icy cold drinks. But why does this incredible substance
        do so much? YouÕll explore the three different states of water through the
        Solid Exhibit, Liquid Exhibit and Vapor Exhibit how each state directly impacts
        ever day or our lives.<br />
        Solid water? That must mean itÕs cold out side. You know what that means? Potholes.
        The ice and snow has to be removed from the streets. But in the process the big
        blades that scrape away at the pavement create nicks and cracks. The ice melts
        to water, freezes, and expands to displace the ground. YouÕll see in our Pothole
        machine how you can add liquid water to a crack in the pavement, quick freeze
        the ground, and then see how big the hole become.<br />
        Liquid water? Most flexible thermal conductive agent in the world. Play around
        with our Hot and Cold exhibit to see how much energy it takes to keep water hot
        or cold. The Pressure Hose area will let you shoot a jet of water at varying
        speed and PSI against plastic, wood, stone and steel. See how long it can take
        to make a hole through each substance with just plain water. Then add abrasive
        materials to give the water ÔgritÕ and then see how long it takes to make those
        same holes!<br />
        Vapor? Steam was the sole reason behind the industrial revolution. The modern
        world we now live in today is because of steam. It was and still is, a viable
        power source. Learn how the simple steam coming off your coffee cup has kept
    the world turning for over 150 years</font></p>    <div id="special">Call now for a special deal on bulk tickets for this event!</div>
