The Science of Sound

What happens when a glass is dropped, a scream is let out, or a guitar sting is plucked? How does the vibration of matter translate into the sounds we hear every day? The answers can be found in the Science of Sound, a new exhibit making its debut at MKI this summer.

Watch and hear how vibrations travel through different elements, and how your ear interprets this energy. You'll even take a look inside of a microphone to see how it converts energy and makes recording possible!
